This week, I’m traveling to Africa for the first time since I left office – a continent of wonderful diversity, thriving culture, and remarkable stories. As I prepare for this trip, I wanted to share a list of books that I’d recommend for summer reading: https://t.co/W4Jc0N23iy
Congratulations to the @Capitals! This @NHLBlackhawks fan knows what it’s like to lift that cup – and I’m happy for all the Caps fans who cheer so hard for their team, and for a team that celebrates so hard with its fans.
“Low plastic stool, cheap but delicious noodles, cold Hanoi beer.” This is how I’ll remember Tony. He taught us about food — but more importantly, about its ability to bring us together. To make us a little less afraid of the unknown. We’ll miss him. https://t.co/orEXIaEMZM
This National Gun Violence Awareness Day, show your commitment to keeping our kids safe from gun violence. Then, for everyone we’ve lost, take action to change our leadership and our laws until they reflect that commitment - no matter how long it takes. https://t.co/lraIwlQAgl
We can never truly repay the debt we owe our fallen heroes. But we can remember them, honor their sacrifice, and affirm in our own lives those enduring ideals of justice, equality, and opportunity for which generations of Americans have given that last full measure of devotion. https://t.co/pRxwmaMClL

Michelle and I are so inspired by all the young people who made today’s marches happen. Keep at it. You’re leading us forward. Nothing can stand in the way of millions of voices calling for change.
Our most important task as a nation is to make sure all our young people can achieve their dreams. We’ve started this work with @MBK_Alliance, but there’s so much more all of us have to do—government, private sector, academia &amp; community leaders—to change the odds for our kids. https://t.co/7f7A0HmK50

Young people have helped lead all our great movements. How inspiring to see it again in so many smart, fearless students standing up for their right to be safe; marching and organizing to remake the world as it should be. We've been waiting for you. And we've got your backs.
Billy Graham was a humble servant who prayed for so many - and who, with wisdom and grace, gave hope and guidance to generations of Americans.
We are grieving with Parkland. But we are not powerless. Caring for our kids is our first job. And until we can honestly say that we're doing enough to keep them safe from harm, including long overdue, common-sense gun safety laws that most Americans want, then we have to change.
Happy Valentine’s Day, @MichelleObama. You make every day and every place better. https://t.co/aWvyytR7Mm
Dr. King was 26 when the Montgomery bus boycott began. He started small, rallying others who believed their efforts mattered, pressing on through challenges and doubts to change our world for the better. A permanent inspiration for the rest of us to keep pushing towards justice.
All across America people chose to get involved, get engaged and stand up. Each of us can make a difference, and all of us ought to try. So go keep changing the world in 2018.

@IdeasAndAction @MarsRovers Mars is infamous for intense dust storms, which sometimes kick up enough dust to be seen by telescopes on Earth. Beyond Mars’ large annual storms are massive storms that occur more rarely but are much larger and more intense. More on Mars' dust storms: https://t.co/AxV0hrQaRU
@aminoacidcereal @MarsRovers You're looking at a global map of Mars showing a growing dust storm as of June 6, 2018. The map was produced by the Mars Color Imager (MARCI) camera on our Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft. The blue dot indicates the approximate location of @MarsRovers Opportunity
@chunkycookei @MarsRovers The @MarsRovers Opportunity has proved hardier than expected by lasting nearly 15 years, despite being designed for a 90-day mission on the surface of the Red Planet. More: https://t.co/pzJtbhBCZL
@JohnFromUCLA @thuggie101 @MarsRovers The @MarsRovers Opportunity's main source of power comes from a multi-panel solar array. For the @MarsCuriosity rover, it uses a radioisotope thermoelectric generator. More on Opportunity's power: https://t.co/4UgcwSottoMore on Curiosity's power: https://t.co/CmWohsSACc
@ikrudolf @MarsRovers We use a network called the Deep Space Network. The network is the largest and most sensitive scientific telecommunications system in the world. Learn more about the network: https://t.co/ETZy5dIO1y
@CuriosityBug @MarsRovers Sure. This is a global map of Mars showing a growing dust storm as of June 6, 2018. The map was produced by the Mars Color Imager (MARCI) camera on our Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft. The blue dot indicates the approximate location of @MarsRovers Opportunity
