One small flare was seen by our @NASASun observatory as it came from the Sun's only visible active region over the week around Feb. 7. The flare sputtered and spurted to eventually unleash this brief, bright flash. Learn more: https://t.co/TrX3IoDSRP https://t.co/RxGo6V1VuO

Our longest running survey of ice ‚Äì Operation @NASA_ICE Bridge ‚Äì shattered records this year. The mission carried out 7 field campaigns in the Arctic &amp; Antarctic and flew over 214,000 miles, the equivalent of orbiting the Earth 8.6 times at the equator! https://t.co/UhOLJtZH3S https://t.co/ptK2TBH2Lb
Yesterday, acting Administrator Lightfoot addressed the #StateOfNASA and highlighted how the FY2019 budget would help the agency achieve its goals for space exploration. Here's a quick recap: https://t.co/Y7AvmHDfhJ https://t.co/7mGklbslsS
The rate of global sea level rise has been accelerating, according to a new study using @NASAEarth data. This acceleration is driven mainly by increased melting in Greenland and Antarctica that could double the total sea level rise projected by 2100. More: https://t.co/3UkgNy9LfQ https://t.co/3B3m00t7nn
Did you know that we‚Äôre watching the Sun 24/7 from space? One of the @NASASun satellites in our fleet has being keeping an eye on the Sun almost every moment of every day for eight years!

Lightfoot at #StateOfNASA: There will be Mars rover, lander &amp; sample return missions; diverse Earth &amp; planetary missions; spacecraft to study the Sun‚Ä¶ Powerful observatories will study other solar systems‚Ä¶and peer back to the dawn of time through other galaxies. https://t.co/wW7hTTjG6W
Lightfoot at #StateOfNASA: Our science portfolio will‚Ä¶increase understanding of our planet and our place in the universe, pursue‚Ä¶discoveries such as whether or not there is life elsewhere in the universe, and scout for knowledge to inform future human advancement into space https://t.co/QlwFA0vZNM
Lightfoot at #StateOfNASA: Our investments in technology lay the groundwork for future human and robotic exploration. We‚Äôre going to invest in a lot of things, from habitat systems to in-space propulsion to entry descent and landing technology to name a few. https://t.co/GyHvnW04rQ
