### hmm-based cOrrection of MIsspelled Tweets ###

This software aims to an Hidden Markov Model that is able to correct the spelling error in small sentences, as for example tweets.

Specifically, it has been shared through this repository:
	- the training procedure used to estimate the three matrices that characterize an HHM (./src/training);
	- a Graphical User Interface through which the best HMM trained can be used to correct the tweets (./src/GUI.py);
	- all the traing and testing sets used (./data).

For any further information about the training procedure and the GUI check out the [Report.pdf](https://github.com/uazadi/OMIT/blob/master/docs/Report.pdf)
